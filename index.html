        <p>The global space incentive is a fraction of what it was during the 1960s, and it‚Äôs only through recent years due to private companies like spaceX that are spearheading the colonial efforts that we are seeing an increase in global incentives for space travel. We should as a species be throwing ourselves at the idea of space exploration because it was through the previous space programs of the 60s that we saw our greatest technological breakthroughs. Unfortunately, after the cold war ended, space travel became less and less frequent but now in the last 10 years the privately funded company SpaceX, owned by Elon Musk is spearheading the exploration of our solar system. </p>

        <p>SpaceX has shown the world that a private company can build and manage rockets with the ability to transport people and cargo around the world. With the dawn of the new SpaceX rocket ‚ÄúStarship‚Äù, expected to be the most cutting edge rocket ever created, a Mars mission has now become feasible. </p>
            
        <p>Increasing the funding and the incentive for space exploration will not only be a great humanitarian investment for humanity, but it will also be an investment that has the ability to kickstart a completely new space industry. Globally incentivised space travel can make us stop conflicting with each other and give us an ultimate goal to work towards.  A new interplanetary goods industry could be created if we push the costs of space travel down far enough. This could be the start of a new era for humanity and it would truly be the next technological revolution. An interplanetary space industry that shuttles minerals and ores to different planets would give us access to so much more material and the cost of producing any product based on minerals would plummet. Expensive electronics would become dirt cheap and the price of raw materials would also drastically decrease. This industry has the potential to raise the standard of living for everyone on Earth and could be revolutionary for humanity.</p>

    <h3 id="aboutus">About Us</h3>
    <div class="breadtext">
        <p>We are a group of swedish computer engineering students at NTI gymnasiet Ume√• and we have been following the work of Elon Musk for a long time. After SpaceX broke through all the barriers and became the first company to privatise space travel we got really interested in space travel. After seeing the potential of space exploration and colonization we concluded that this has the ability to revolutionize humanity, this is when we began campaigning for more space exploration and increased space program funding.        </p>

    <h3 id="faq">FAQ</h3>
    <div class="breadtext" >
        <p> Q: Should we be focusing our attention on other world problems? Space is something that you do because it is interesting and fun not to help humanity.

        <p> A: Increasing the size of space programs around the world has the potential to usher in a new era of science and technology. If we as a species want to increase the pace of technological strides then space programs are one of the best things you can put your money in. Just look at what the space programs of the 60s did for global research.

        <p> Q: Why Mars? It‚Äôs not a hospitable planet for humans.

        <p> A: Mars is a fantastic place to start humanity's great exploration of the solar system. Basically due to distance, atmospheric density and gravity, Mars is a great place to start and once we have conquered Mars we can conquer the rest of the solar system. The lessons we learn while attempting to reach Mars will be vital and might allow us to start independent economic missions that trade resources with other planets and also missions with the goal of mining asteroids. As for the dangers, learning to survive on Mars and creating a secure life of relative luxury will be a great stepping stone for the colonization of the rest of the solar system. There are far more dangerous planets waiting to be exploited and if we can survive Mars, we can survive anything.

        <p> Q: Why now?

        <p> A: The interest in space is at an all time high measured from the 2000s and as global conflicts plague the world, a mission to Mars could unify us all. It will give the nations of the world a peaceful goal to all work towards while also providing a potential economic benefit in 30 years if mineral exports become economically viable.

        <p> Q: Where will the money come from?
        
        <p> A: The funding of these space programs would hopefully come from a budget reduction of national militaries. As a species we are wasting so much money and resources on hostility when we can look past our differences and focus on a common goal that will unify and positively affect all of humanity. 

        <p> Q: How do I make a difference?
        
        <p> A: With your VOTE! Talk to politicians, officials and organisations. Use your vote to better humanity and make space colonization a greater subject of discussion for the people of earth and the governments of the world will follow, vote for more space!
